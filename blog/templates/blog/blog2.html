<p> In this entry, I will be focusing on the start- up of my website blog and trying to use code for the first time. I put my research into practice and started to follow the DSM Django Girls Tutorial, we started this in class which was great as I could ask my tutor and classmates for help when I got stuck or was unsure what to do.  

At first I found the tutorial quiet confusing as I was not familiar or use to all the technical terms being used to describe what I was doing. However, after reading the descriptions provided about what I was doing and what everything meant I gained confidence and could proceed in the steps. 

The first step to creating a blog is setting up a virtual environment in Python and installing Django. I found these steps a bit difficult as it was my first time practicing and exercising code and it took me a lot longer than expected. However, once I got the hang of it and understood what I was doing the next steps were a lot easier and ran a bit smoother. I did not face any real problems until I reached the step ‘create tables for models in your database’ under the step Django Models.  

I was stuck on this step for over a week and could not figure out the problem or what I needed to do to fix the situation, I decided I would ask my tutor for help as all the research and methods I tried were unsuccessful. He suggested I follow the actual Django Girls tutorial released by Django not the one on our class website as it is more recent and up to date. As a result, I decided to re-start my whole project to ensure what I was coding and entering is the most recent information and it finally worked! I past the step and I could code “python manage.py make migrations blog”and was finally able to progress in my website. 

Although I have been following step by step the tutorial I want to put my own twist on the blog website and make it appear different or function differently to what they have produced in the Tutorial.  I believe by adding my own creativity to the blog website it highlights my code literacy and sets me apart from the tutorial.  I discovered Python is known as a glue language, thus you can take code from other languages. Ford states this as you can “embed the older, faster code in the newer, slower, but easier-to-use system” (Ford 2015), this has got me thinking once I finish the steps and have created my blog I should important other code or other features into my blog to enhance my code literacy. </p>
