<h3> Blog 3 </h3> 
<p> 
In this entry, I want to talk about how code is becoming such an important factor of society, this week as a class we went to the Hello World: Code and Design exhibition curated by Aaron Seymour. This exhibition opened my eyes to how code affects everything, not just web development and applications. The exhibit reiterated Giests point that “coding has emerged as an essential, world-making practice” (UTS Art 2018) and is a skill that will become integral for success in the future. The exhibit incorporated both aspects of code and design and displayed things ranging from 3D printing, stacks of cups displaying code, Arduino light circuits and even dresses influenced by code. These displays really show the connection between design and code within the 21st century and how code is emerging as a new dominant tool used to create almost anything. 

I believe this emergence of code is a great thing as I have learnt over this semester it really is a useful skill to possess. Within the last couple of weeks, I have been working on my website blog and have been making some great progress and starting to really understand what I am doing and how this projects onto my blog. I have started using GitHub and python anywhere to make my website blog go live and be hosted on the internet and have started learning HTML to customize and create my actual website.

I introduced myself to HTML and I am currently up to the step Introduction to HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Makeup Language and is classified as a markup language; therefore, it has been marked with tags that provide information for the web browser to decode (Crymble & Turkel 2012). My HTML file template is divided into two elements the head and the body, this is where I place my headings and the information I want to be shown on my blog website through tags. It was fun to see the way I could set out and customize my blog through this HTML template. After creating this template, I now should see if it runs correctly and to do so I need to use GitHub and python anywhere.

Using GitHub and python anywhere was relatively easily due to already using python and sublime on my computer, so I felt comfortable coding and had a basic understanding of what I was working. These two accounts are more just for storing and holding my code to ensure my website can go live. I learnt all about Git during this process and basic git commands, thus learning how to make changes locally and then push these changed to git hub and then pull them onto python anywhere and as a result, update my blog website. Once I learnt how to use git commands properly it made updating my blog a lot easier as I started to understand what each command meant so I did not have to keep looking back in the tutorial to figure out what to type to perform what I wanted, thus improving my code literacy. </p>

this week in class we used Tableau public to create visual maps and data visualization, this was a valuable and practical skill to learn and made me think I should add some visuals to my website blog if I have enough time and the capability to do so. We used Tableau to display data in a professional and attractive way to maintain the integrity of our work, Tufte states “the highest standards of statistical integrity and statistical thinking should apply to every data representation, including visual displays” (Tufte 1997, p. 35). I believe the map we created maintained its statistical integrity, as you can see in image 1. Image 1 represents all electorates in NSW with a mean taxable income of $60,000 to $100,000 and a donation values of more 
than $5,000,00. 

Carrying on from the class Tableau work, I decided to research how I would be able to add an image to my blog website. I researched how to add an image using HTML as that is where I hold my template for my blog website. To add an image, I would have to add <img> tag into my HTML template and then link it to the URL of the image I would like to use. I am thinking I will add images in the final weeks of creating my blog when I am fine tuning the appearance because at the moment my main priority is completing the tutorial to ensure my blog is functional and easy to use. Once I am happy with the function of my blog and if I have enough time I would love to add a few images to make my blog more personal and more appealing to the eye

In relation to my website blog progress, I decided to customize my blog a little bit more and after finalising my HTML template the next step is to push all the changes and then refresh and have a working website. However, my URL was not working anymore and all the changes did not commit. I was quite stuck on this step as I was unsure how to fix it or what to do and we did not have class till next Thursday. I tried searching online but I was getting a lot more confused and then I found the Django Girls Tutorial gitter group chat and decided to join this chat and ask for some assistance.

I was very happy with joining the Django Girls tutorial gitter group chat and I think it is a great resource for me, there are many people asking questions and providing guidance when errors occur. My website blog was reporting the issue as needing to fix DEBUG and the group chat kindly helped me and assisted me in moving past this step. I did not commit my local changes properly and my repertories were not up to date, as I did not commit and push them correctly. After fixing this step and pushing them correctly my blog was up and running!</p>
