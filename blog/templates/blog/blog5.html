<header> Blog Post 5 </header>

<p> This is the final week before my Artefact is due and this is the week I have started to fine tune and finalise my website blog. At this stage I have a functioning website blog however it does not showcase any of my own style or colours in relation to the aesthetic of the website blog. So, in this coming week I will be using my CSS and HTML files to add my own personal touch and customize the blog to make it different to the Django Girls Tutorial blog and to try make it aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I am very proud of myself for being able to stick to my perceived time line and finish the blog with over a week to customize and fine tune its appearance. </p>

<p> I want to be able to change the font, colour and margins of my website blog to just make it more appealing and to show I have the code literacy to be able to customize it differently form the tutorial I also want to add images and create multiple pages on my website for each blog post. In trying to do so I have faced a lot of problems with my CSS files and their connection to my website. I am not sure if it is my HTML or my CSS file that has the issue or if the issue is they are not connected properly, so I have decided to try and research online and see if there are any suggestions on why this error is occurring. </p>

<p> I followed the research which said to make sure my CSS file was connected and placed in my HTML which it was correctly and to also try refreshing my “cache” browsing data and the updates should occur, however I was still faced with my issue and my CSS was not updating to my blog.  After researching some more, I found the problem in my python anywhere bash console I was not using the commands “workon millyshelston.pythonanywhere” and then “python manage.py collect static” by doing so it collects the new static CSS file and showcases them on my website. </p>

</p> Once I realized how to correctly update my CSS files, I spent the remainder of my time fine tuning my website blogs appearance. I tried to change as much as I could from the Django Girls Tutorial appearance to highlight my code abilities whilst add my own personal preference to the blog. The last and final step was adding content to my website, I started with adding each journal post and adding photos that I have used in my journal entries to show I was capable to use code to add images to my website blog. 

Overall I am pleased with my progress in the subject at the start of the semester I had no prior knowledge on how to code or what code is and by the end of the semester I used code to create a functioning blog website. This semester has dramatically increased my code literacy in relation to my blog website and other coding activities we have learnt and discussed in class. </p>
