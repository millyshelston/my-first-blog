<header> Blog Post 1 </header>

<p> This semester I will be creating a website blog that will display my A2 blog posts. I decided to create this project as it is my first-time coding and I believe this is a good starting point for learning and understanding code literacy and a useful skill I will be able to use throughout university and in the workplace. It is essential to have at least have a basic understanding of code literacy in the 21st century due to the increasingly high use of technology within our society. Geist states “learning the language of these devices may become as important as learning mathematics, science, or reading” (Geist 2016, p. 299) and for this reason, I believe it is important I participated in this subject and try learning code to better myself in society and the workplace. </p>


<p> To achieve creating my website blog I have had to utilise my class time wisely and conduct further research to understand what codes I will need to use. I used this week to decide whether I would use Tumblr to hand-code my website blog or Django, after researching and reading through the DSM Django Girls Tutorial I decided I would use Django and follow the tutorial. I decided to make my website powered by Django as I am unfamiliar with coding and we use Django in class, therefore, I will be able to gain a better understanding and use my class time to develop my code literacy and ask questions if I need help. </p>


<p> To create a Django powered website blog there are a few things I have needed to download and research to further my code literacy. I will be using Python, Django, HTML, and CSS to create code for my blog, I will be using Sublime as my code editor and I also will be using GitHub to hold my code online and PythonAnywhere to host and publish my website. I have never used any of these programs before so this week I focused on conducting some background research to gain a basic understanding on Python and Django as they are the first steps in the tutorial thus it is essential I have a basic understanding. I discovered that Python is a high-level programming language that can be used for multiple things such as general programming, web and internet development, education and game development (Python Software Foundation 2018). Django is a Python-based web framework that works fast and efficiently to develop functioning websites (Django Project 2018). Both Python and Django communicate they are easy for beginners and have several resources such as tutorials, fact sheets and group chats available if you face a problem while coding, I found that a useful fact as I am sure in the following weeks I will need guidance. </p>

</p> Throughout this whole semester, I hope to further my code literacy in these applications and understand the fundamentals that are needed to create a website using code. Now that I have decided I will be using Django and have conducted research and familiarised myself with Python and Django, the next step is starting to put this research into practice and start creating my blog. </p>
